Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for travelling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins.

After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400;""> </p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400;"">Essentially, every turn a player will play two cards out of their hand. Each card has a number at the top, and the number on the first card played will determine their initiative order. Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it is a player's turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other, or vice-versa. Players must be careful, though, because over time they will permanently lose cards from their hands. If they take too long to clear a dungeon, they may end up exhausted and be forced to retreat.</p>

Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.</p>
<p>The players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The projects (cards) can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41 megacredits, depending on the project). Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.</p>
<p>Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters. However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.</p>
<p>Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:</p>
<p>1) Player order shifts clockwise.<br><br>2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.<br><br>3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.<br><br>4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.</p>
<p>When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation. Count your Terraform Rating and other VPs to determine the winning corporation!</p>

<div>Don’t just survive the long, cold Dueling winter; thrive with Raging Tempest, this February’s brand-new 100-card booster set! Raging Tempest starts off three new themes and enhances many previously released themes, including strategies from Dimension of Chaos, Breakers of Shadow, High-Speed Riders, Wing Raiders, Dragons of Legend –Unleashed–, the Pendulum Domination Structure Deck, and even an upcoming Structure Deck!</div>
<div>In addition to great new cards for a variety of themes, Raging Tempest also has many powerful standalone cards that can be used in many different Decks. From a new card in the extremely potent “Virus” series that began with Kaiba’s Crush Card Virus to a gargantuan monster that can reset reality, Raging Tempest is sure to heat things up on February 10th.  Here’s a little more of what to look forward to!</div>
<div>A brand-new team of Beast-Warriors that redefine Xyz Summoning! Any of the 4 Xyz Monsters in this theme can be Summoned using any 1 other monster from the theme – even if it’s not an Xyz Monster! Each of the non-Xyz Beast-Warriors from this theme adds its ATK, DEF, and a special effect to the Xyz Monsters and there are lots of ways to add more Xyz Materials. This is a great theme for creative Duelists who like to invent new strategies for Summoning the biggest, toughest monsters possible!</div>
<div>Royal Spirits who conjure gale force winds to blast your opponent’s cards back to the hand or Deck! These powerful Spirits are Ritual Monsters that work well with cards from Dragons of Legend –Unleashed– and Shining Victories.</div>
<div>The Crystrons from Invasion: Vengeance return for another round of timeline-altering mayhem and this time they’re rewriting the rules of Synchro Summoning! Normally you use 1 Tuner and 1 or more non-Tuners, but the newest Crystron Synchro Monster uses more than 1 Tuner and exactly 1 non-Tuner instead!</div>
<div>The Subterror Behemoths continue their attack on The Hidden City! The hypnotic cries of these horrors allow them to temporarily control the denizens of the City and suppress interference from card effects, forcing Subterror Nemesis Warrior and his comrades to fight alone against the monsters. As the Behemoth attacks become more frequent, will they be able to hold out?</div>
<div>New orders! SPYRAL has identified the leaders of the international syndicate they’ve been investigating, and now SPYRAL Super Agent is assembling a team of fellow agents to capture them.

<p>Humanity’s greatest fear has been realized! Dueling A.I.s have become sentient and organized their own army to take the Yu-Gi-Oh! TRADING CARD GAME by storm in<span> </span><em>Ignition Assault</em>! Winter 2020’s 100-card booster set heats things up with Ai’s “@Ignister” cards from the climax of<span> </span><em>Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS</em>, multiple brand-new strategies, new cards for popular strategies, and powerful, general use cards that every Duelist will want to add to their arsenal!</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep your A.I. on the prize! Ai’s “@Ignister” strategy is a Cyberse theme with mastery of Link, Ritual, Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz Summoning!<span> </span><strong>Cynet Mining</strong><span> </span>from<span> </span><em>Dark Neostorm<span> </span></em>and<span> </span><strong>Firewall Dragon Darkfluid<span> </span></strong>from<span> </span><em>Chaos Impact<span> </span></em>will help you to maximize this Deck’s capabilities.</li>
<li>A new Beast-Warrior theme that you can use, even if you don’t have an Extra Deck, or you’re just starting to build your Extra Deck with cards from<span> </span><em>Duel Devastator</em>. This theme makes use of Continuous Spells and Traps, so keep your “Fire Formation” cards from<span> </span><em>Fists of the Gadgets<span> </span></em>at the ready.</li>
<li>No Ritual Spells? No problem! A megalithic new Ritual theme where the monsters themselves do all the heavy lifting.</li>
<li>Become the scourge of the high seas! A new theme based on pirates and their ships smuggles its way into the Yu-Gi-Oh! TRADING CARD GAME. How is “piracy” in a Duel defined? How about “getting what you don’t pay for,” in this case, getting monsters out of your Extra Deck without using any materials!</li>
<li><em>Ignition Assault<span> </span></em>also bolsters themes like Karakuri, Witchcrafter, Time Thief, and more!</li>
<li>Multiple general-use cards applicable to any Deck. If you’re looking for a new mass removal Spell that can handle any type of card, or a Trap that can add any card from your Deck to your hand, look no further than<span> </span><em>Ignition Assault</em>!</li>
