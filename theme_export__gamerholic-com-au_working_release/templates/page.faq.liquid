<h2>8.&nbsp;Can I pick up my order myself?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Yes, you can. However, all pickups need to be arranged prior to make an order to ensure that we can meet your requirements as we are an online store.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>9.&nbsp;What happens if my item shows as delivered but it wasn't delivered?&nbsp;</h2>
<p><span>We strive to resolve all issues as soon as possible but&nbsp;each case could take 3-10 business days to investigate and resolve. Also, we need to engage with our courier to confirm if the item has been delivered or delivered incorrectly before we could provide an update.&nbsp;</span></p>
